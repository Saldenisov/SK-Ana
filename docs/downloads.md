# __Downloads__ module

Two functionalities in this module:

  - `Generate Report`: generates a .html file containing the results of
    the analysis. You can choose to omit `SVD` or `ALS`. To generate and
    download the report, **`Ctrl+Click`** on `Download` (if you simply
    click, this will crash the app and you will loose all your hard
    work…)

  - `Get my files`: generates a .zip archive with all the files you
    saved to disk in the previous modules. To download the archive,
    **`Ctrl+Click`** on `Download` (if you simply click, this will
    crashe the app and you will loose all your hard work…)
    
    **Note**: all files with names starting by you project’s name 
    are included in the .zip file. If you never change the project’s 
    name, you might gather older files along…

**Remarks**

  - these downloads should go to your default `Downloads` folder

  - if you run SK-Ana locally, the saved files are stored in
    `SK-Ana/outputdir` and you can simply pick them up from there.
