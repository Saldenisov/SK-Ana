# Introduction

The `SK-Ana` graphical interface is organized in sequential order
of project management:

* `Project`: define a project's name and load the data

* `Data Selection`: define the data subset to be treated

* `SVD`: perform Singular Values Decomposition analysis

* `ALS`: perform Alternated Least-Squares decomposition

* `Kinet`: constrain the analysis by a kinetic model

* `Downloads`: download saved the results and/or a report

* `About`: information about the code
 
# Workflow

A typical workflow consists in the sequence:

```
`Project` > (`Data Selection` > `SVD` > `ALS`) > `Downloads`
```

where the sequence between parentheses is iterated until _satisfecit_.
Technically, the `SVD` step could be avoided for an ALS analysis, 
but it provides a lot of useful information and should not be overlooked.

## Project

Project definition and data input.

### `New Project`

+ __`Project Name`__: choose a name. If not, a name will be generated
from the datafiles selected below.
    
+ __`Predefined File Formats`__: a few data file formats have been
predefined from the datafiles of different experiments. 
Choose the one corresponding to your data. For
fine tuning, select 'Other...' which will open a new panel.
    
    |         |Header | Separator | Decimal | Data structure 
    |---------|-------|-----------|---------|---------------      
    | CSV     | FALSE |   ','     | '.'     | wxd
    | ELYSE   | FALSE |   '\\t'   | '.'     | wxd
    | Fluo    | FALSE |   ';'     | '.'     | wxd
    | Streak  | TRUE  |   ','     | '.'     | wxd
        
    - `Header`: does the first line contain column headers ?
        
    - `Separator`: symbol used to separate the columns
        
    - `Decimal`: character used in the file for decimal points
        
    - `Data structure`: 
        
        * `wxd`: wavelength in columns; delays in lines
        
        * `dxw`: delays in columns; wavelengths in lines
  
+ __`Load-time compression factors`__: the data can be averaged by blocks
at load time to save processing time and reduce noise. 
    
    - `Delay` width (in pixels) of the block in delay dimension
        
    - `Wavl` width (in pixels) of the block in wavelength dimension
        
+ __`Select data file(s)`__: select one or several files to be analyzed.
Selecting the files will create new items in the right panel:
    
    - a success message '__Data Loaded !__'
        
    - an active table with a description of the file(s). 
    When several files have been loaded:
          
        * it is possible to use the table to select a subset 
          or to reorder them.

        * a menu appears with processing options:
            
            + `Average`: average the selected files
                
            + `Tile Wavl`: assemble the matrices in the wavelength dimension
                
            + `Tile Delay` (default): assemble the matrices
              in the delay dimension. In this case, the delay coordinate
              is replaced by an index.
                
            + press on __`Do It!`__ to process the data
                
    - a summary of the processed matrix
        
    - a vignette of the processed matrix

+ __`Post-process compression factor`__: the block averaging is
  performed _after_ the data files are assembled.
